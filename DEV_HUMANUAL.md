# 👋 Hey, I’m Karlo

> A generalist software engineer who builds systems that *feel* right — minimal, practical, and meaningful.  
> Currently on Fedora 42, Wayland-only. ADHD-coded and powered by curiosity.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🧩 INFP-T | Thinks like a system, feels like a human.  
- 🛠️ I build things across multiple domains:
  - Python / C++ / Bash / TypeScript  
  - Next.js (App Router, pnpm, TypeScript-first)  
  - SQLite, Supabase, Docker  
  - A bit of embedded tinkering & forensics (still learning)  
- 🎨 Design-inclined — prefers clean UIs and predictable UX (Material Design 3 fan).  
- 💡 I experiment first, document after (don’t worry, I comment well).

## ⚙️ What Drives Me

- Solving real problems with simple, elegant solutions.  
- Building modular systems that *scale without chaos*.  
- Learning by breaking things — then fixing them cleaner.  
- Exploring how tech, design, and culture connect.  

I like working on things that **mean something**, not just *do something*.

## 🧭 Current Focus

- 🧱 Mastering Next.js 15+ with proper CI/CD pipelines  
- 🧑‍💻 Building *Klima* - crowdsourced app for disaster safety
- 🧩 Learning Material Design 3 deeply (beyond surface aesthetics)  
- 🈺 Improving my Japanese (N5 → N3 goal)  
- 🧰 Exploring cybersecurity & forensics more hands-on

## 💬 How to Work With Me

- Prefer **async communication** (messages > meetings).  
- Be **clear and direct** — bullet points work best.  
- I value **autonomy** — trust me to figure things out.  
- Feedback? Make it **specific** and **actionable**.  
- I’ll mirror your energy: chill = chill, focused = focused.  

> TL;DR: I don’t need micromanagement. I need clarity, context, and time to build.

## ⚡ Known Quirks

| Issue | Description | Patch |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `#001` | Hyperfocus loop | Break every 90 mins, reset context |
| `#002` | Forgetting to rest | Add “downtime” to tasklist |
| `#003` | Too many open tabs | Use `focus --deep` mode |
| `#004` | Loses momentum in ambiguity | Request goal clarification early |

---

## 🧩 Ideal Environment

- Linux-native workflows (Fedora / GNOME / terminal-friendly)
- Versioned, structured, and readable codebases  
- Clear project scopes, async updates, and shared context  
- Feedback loops > endless meetings  
- Teams that value *clarity and trust* over “hustle”

## 🔐 For Non-Technical Readers

Karlo builds digital systems the way artists design spaces — thoughtful, balanced, and functional.  
He learns fast, adapts faster, and prefers working with people who value **clarity, autonomy, and purpose**.  
Give him a problem with meaning, and he’ll build something that works — and makes sense.
